# Robotic-1

•	Developed a low-level pose and velocity control system for a unicycle mobile robot in a lab environment, using Git, Python, ROS, and C++ for Arduino. Thus, I designed and implemented an autonomous driving control system for the robot, utilizing camera and LIDAR data for lane following and obstacle avoidance, using Gazebo, RViz, Python, and NumPy.


•	Created a deep learning-based sign recognition system and vision-based control to react to signs, using TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV.


•	Built an overall control architecture for the robot, organizing it in a state machine and developing well-structured software while working with a real robot.
